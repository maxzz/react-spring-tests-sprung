## About

React Spring provides us the power of spring physics to create animations that resemble of how things in real life.
But it can be difficult for a newbie to learn, I thought I'd contribute some basic examples of how each hook works and
the different ways we can trigger them.

This repo contains an ELI5 tutorial with examples for the following

- useSpring
- useSprings
- useTrail
- useTransition
- useChain

## Installing

Clone the repo into your desired folder then:

```
cd Im-SPRUNG-react-spring-tutorial
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## How to use

Simply open `App.tsx` and uncomment the component corresponding to the hook you are trying to learn and save to reload the page.

In the `./src/animations` you will find each componenent with comments explaining how it works. The examples are at the bottom where we return the tsx.
If you want to see the second/third example comment out the current example and uncomment desired example, reload and voila!

## troubleshooting

Because this uses vite if you `cdm + s` or `ctrl + s` it will auto-reload the page for you. But sometimes the hmr stops working so you need
to open the `vite.config.ts` in an adjacent window and save that file for the auto-reload
